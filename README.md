# -- Odin Recipes

I made this project to practice HTML by building a simple recipe website. It has a homepage that links to recipe pages. I'll add CSS styling later.

## Setup

- Create a public repo called `odin-recipes`.
- Clone it locally using SSH.
- Work locally, commit often, and push regularly.

## Structure

- `index.html`: main page with recipe links.
- `recipes/`: folder with pages for each recipe.
- Each recipe page has a title, image, description, ingredients, and steps.
- Recipe pages link back to the main page.

## Tips

- Avoid editing files directly on GitHub after cloning.
- Commit often.
- Try to solve problems on your own before looking at others' solutions.

## Publish

Enable GitHub Pages in settings (main branch) to publish your site at:  
`https://your-username.github.io/odin-recipes`

# NOTE ::

- Having fun is more important,
- Make sure to have fun on your own way,
- Enjoy ...
