# Odin Recipes

I made this project to practice HTML by building a simple recipe website. It has a homepage that links to recipe pages. I later enhanced the project by adding internal CSS styling directly into each HTML file to make the site fully responsive and visually appealing across all devices.

## Setup

- Create a public repo called `odin-recipes`.
- Clone it locally using SSH.
- Work locally, commit often, and push regularly.

---

## Structure

- `index.html`: main page with recipe links.
- `recipes/`: folder with pages for each recipe.
- Each recipe page has a title, image, description, ingredients, and steps.
- Recipe pages link back to the main page.
- Internal CSS styling added to each page for:
  - Responsive layouts using flexible widths and media queries.
  - Modern typography and spacing.
  - Styled links, headings, images, and buttons for a polished look.

## Tips

- Avoid editing files directly on GitHub after cloning.
- Commit often with clear, descriptive messages.
- Try to solve problems on your own before looking at others' solutions.
