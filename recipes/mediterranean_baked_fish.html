  <h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Step 1:</strong>
    <p>
    Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
    </p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Step 2:</strong>
    <p>
    2 tablespoons olive oil in an oven-safe nonstick skillet over medium heat.<br>
    When oil shimmers, add onions and cook, stirring frequently,<br>
    until onions are translucent, 3 to 4 minutes.<br>
    Stir in garlic, and cook, stirring, about 30 seconds.
    </p>
    </li>
  <li><strong>Step 3:</strong>
    <p>
    Add cherry tomatoes and wine, and season with salt and pepper.<br>
    Add 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning and red pepper flakes.<br>
    Toss to combine, and cook about 1 minute.<br>
    Remove from heat and stir in sliced olives, chopped spinach, and cream.
    </p>
    </li>
  <li><strong>Step 4:</strong>
    <p>
    Nestle fillets into vegetable mixture,<br>
    sprinkle each fillet with salt and pepper,<br> 
    and drizzle remaining olive oil over the entire dish.<br> 
    Brush the olive oil to cover the surface of each fillet.<br>
    Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning.<br>
    </p>
    </li>
  <li><strong>Step 5:</strong>
    <p>
    Bake in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, 20 to 25 minutes.<br>
    An instant-read thermometer inserted near the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
    </p>
    </li>
  <li><strong>Step 6:</strong>

    Serve with hot, cooked pasta or rice, and garnish with fresh parsley.
